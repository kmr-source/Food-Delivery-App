https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~kaitimk/frontend/screens/home.php

### Project Description
Food Delivery Application will be the domain for our project. The domain will focus on  customer and delivery management
logistics, primarily on the data exchanged between the users and restaurants.  The goal of our project is to identify
how long it takes on average for a food order to be placed, prepared, and delivered from a restaurant to its customers,
as well as how payments are made by customers and received by the restaurants and drivers. Customers can also provide
feedback to restaurants. Orders can also have complaints made by the user.
